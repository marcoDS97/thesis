# What will be placed here?
I'd like to use this space to store materials related to my master's thesis. I will, in particular, include the entire code for that project here. Because I'm still learning Python and R, the code will most likely not be the best you've seen so far. I'm aware of this, and I'm doing my best to improve that side.

# Thesis topic
This thesis focuses on analysing the role that politics has in determining certain attitudes and behaviour regarding climate change. These consequently, as identified in many analyses, have an impact on whether or not climate change policies are approved. However, other socio-demographic determinants must also be considered. The entire project will be based on the 2016 ESS8 database, which includes an entire section dedicated to climate change. This database also allows for comparisons of various European countries.

# What will be done?
Before using the ESS8 database, the thesis will investigate the role of political orientation in various countries. A graphical analysis of some data that could be useful in this regard would be beneficial.
Afterwards, a descriptive analysis and then a statistical analysis, using the ESS8 database, will be conducted.
